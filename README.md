hibernate-example
=================
Cloned from https://github.com/szantopeter/hibernate-example

Goal is to demonstrate 
* flaw in querydsl hibernate binding that was resolved in querydsl JPA binding 
* simplicity of conversion from hibernate to JPA binding with newer Hibernate since QueryDSL wasn't maintained at that time.

**Bottom line**: the bug was resolved with newer QueryDSL
